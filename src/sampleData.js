6/8/19, 11:12 - Adriana Lam: Apparently it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe thing‚Äù to do

6/8/19, 13:02 - Yuxi: <Media omitted>
6/8/19, 13:04 - Adriana Lam: Cool! Have some apartment things I need to deal with this afternoon but I‚Äôll have some ideas this evening
6/8/19, 13:05 - Adriana Lam: Hope to have accomm settled and locked in for the rest of our trip tonight and have a general outline for our week there
6/8/19, 13:06 - Adriana Lam: Do any of you have a go pro?
6/8/19, 13:16 - Yuxi: I have one, have had a hard time getting it to sync but it works
6/8/19, 14:07 - Geri: Ok with the shark thing, no go pro for me
6/8/19, 14:07 - Adriana Lam: Some notes 
Delheim- Cape Malay Dinner followed by Cupcake and wine tasting
Avontuur Estate - self walking tour, Fudge and Wine pairing
6/8/19, 14:13 - Yuxi: Dumb question but right now are we just looking for things to do August 22-25? And we're doing a wine tour the days we're in Cape Town before that? I've clearly not been following all of the texts (plan on going through them this weekend)
6/8/19, 14:33 - Adriana Lam: I think it‚Äôs still being decided up in the air
6/8/19, 14:34 - Adriana Lam: Johan and I have only booked flights to Capetown and the Capetown hotel and trying to get ourselves sorted by tonight then will have a better idea of activities and restaurants
6/8/19, 14:34 - Geri: yes we should be doing wine tours when we're in Franschoek (wine country) 19-22 Aug and Cape Town other things
6/8/19, 14:36 - Geri: Yuxi what I was trying to tell you was since you had a lot of things / friends you wanted to catch up in, instead of going to Zanzibar (since you dont dive anyway), you should be headed to Cape Town direct from the safari as right now the itinerary if you follow mine only allows you 2 days in CT
6/8/19, 14:39 - Adriana Lam: Wine tour ‚úÖ Geri can you forward? i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the bookings email
6/8/19, 14:40 - Geri: I will when I get home am out!
6/8/19, 14:44 - Yuxi: I have one friend but I hear what you're saying. The beach day sounds like a good idea and I'll investigate if I want that second day. I've peeked at the flights and I'm not seeing yours anyways so I might adjust depending on that.
6/8/19, 14:48 - Adriana Lam: We‚Äôre excited!!
6/8/19, 14:48 - Adriana Lam: Yuxi exactly what have you booked?
6/8/19, 14:52 - Yuxi: The flight there and back. I'm talking to the safari but I know, as of now, I need to book the flight from Zanzibar to Cape Town. I need a night in Doha.
6/8/19, 14:54 - Geri: Btw you can adjust the safari to leave from Arusha to Cape Town, it doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly the same
6/8/19, 14:54 - Yuxi: I know. Apparently they just got back from some national holiday where nobody was working for 2-3 days
6/8/19, 14:54 - Geri: And btw Cape Town has beaches if you want a beach day, why Sandra and I are doing Zanzibar is cos of the diving
6/8/19, 14:55 - Yuxi: The regular swing dance is on an off week from when we're there anyways
6/8/19, 16:52 - Geri: ok the only 2 things that i have confirmed bookings for are 1) Lunch at Delaire Graff on 22nd Aug (figured we do this enroute to Cape Town from Franschoek, supposed to GORGEOUS view) - we can either do a wine tour at Delaire Graff before or after lunch (no need to book i asked) 2) wine tasting at mullineax & leeu (part of our hotel's wine thing) for 21 aug 11am
6/8/19, 16:52 - Geri: sent a few other enquiries which i also forwarded you but all those either are walk in or dont accept bookings so far out
6/8/19, 17:48 - Adriana Lam: Cool cool! Will take a look when we are home
6/8/19, 17:48 - Adriana Lam: Thanks Geri!
6/11/19, 12:59 - Yuxi: Geraldine and Sandra, the booking company said Acacia Lodge is fully booked and they've reached out to you. A little confused and/or sorry if that affected your reservation
6/11/19, 13:25 - Geri: They‚Äôre fully booked for triple rooms so I‚Äôve asked 1) what other accoms have triple rooms (will compare against Acacia Lodge as I really like the place), 2) if you can get a single room in Acacia Lodge and 3) if there is no availability period in Acacia Lodge what is the closest available single room lodging
6/11/19, 13:55 - Yuxi: I've actually asked for other accommodations already instead of Acacia Lodge, or rather he's suggested, so I'm a little confused too
6/11/19, 22:57 - Adriana Lam: Okay guys! Our itinerary is fairly set now
16th - Leave LHR`
